# Tick Tach Watch Timergrapher
## Tick-Tach: A DIY Timegrapher for Watch Enthusiasts

  Mechanical watches may seem timeless, but keeping them accurate requires precise adjustment. That’s where a timegrapher comes in. Traditionally a tool for professional watchmakers, a timegrapher measures the tiny variations in a watch’s ticking to reveal how well its movement is performing.

## What a Timegrapher Does

At its core, a timegrapher listens to the tick-tock of a mechanical watch and turns that sound into data. The key readings are:

  Rate – how many seconds the watch gains or loses per day.

  Amplitude – the swing of the balance wheel, an indicator of movement power.

  Beat Error – how evenly spaced the tick and tock are, showing whether the balance is centred.

  Together, these measurements tell whether a watch is healthy, in need of regulation, or due for service.

## The Tick-Tach Approach

  Tick-Tach is a DIY project that recreates the essential functions of a timegrapher using simple, accessible parts. Instead of an expensive acoustic sensor, Tick-Tach relies on a piezoelectric microphone to detect the faint vibrations of a watch. The weak signal is amplified with a transistor-based preamp before being processed into meaningful timing data.

  Unlike commercial probes, Tick-Tach’s electronics are housed in a custom 3D-printed enclosure. The case (shown above) is designed with a circular recess for the watch to rest on, a cavity for the piezo sensor, a neatly integrated preamp board, and a headphone-style jack for easy connection. A small toggle switch adds convenience. A hair bobble is integrated into the case to retain the watch when rotating, during different position tests.

Tick-Tach is also software compatible, working with the open-source “tg-timer”, "PC Timer Machine" application on PC and the "Watch Accuracy Meter" app on Android. This allows users to visualise live waveforms, track performance, and adjust their watches using the platform they prefer.

## Why It Matters

  For hobbyists, modders, and independent watch repairers, commercial timegraphers can be costly. Tick-Tach lowers the barrier, offering enthusiasts a practical way to check accuracy, regulate their watches, and better understand the mechanics inside. It’s also a rewarding build for anyone into electronics, 3D printing, and horology.

With its smart enclosure and open-source software compatibility, Tick-Tach bridges the gap between professional watchmaking tools and the DIY workshop.
